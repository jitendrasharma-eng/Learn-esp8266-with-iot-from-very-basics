# Learn-esp8266-with-iot-from-very-basics
This repository contains 8 hands-on experiments to help beginners learn esp8266 with iot and hardware interfacing step by step. Each experiment includes circuit diagrams, code, and explanations.

Experiment 1: Blinking LED with ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
Components:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
LED (any color)
220Œ© resistor
The blinking LED experiment is the "Hello World" of embedded systems. It demonstrates how to control an LED using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) board.  ESP8266 uses GPIO pins, such as D5.

How It Works:
The setup() function configures D5 as an output pin. The loop() function turns the LED ON for 1 second and then OFF for 1 second, repeating indefinitely.

How to Run This Experiment:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the LED to D5 of ESP8266 (with a 220Œ© resistor in series).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the provided code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU board.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the LED blinking every 1 second.

Experiment 2: Connecting ESP8266 to Wi-Fi
Components:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
Wi-Fi Network (SSID & Password)
Computer with Arduino IDE
This experiment demonstrates how to connect an ESP8266 NodeMCU to a Wi-Fi network. The ESP8266 can connect to a Wi-Fi router, allowing it to communicate over the internet or a local network.

How It Works:
The setup() function initializes the serial monitor and starts the Wi-Fi connection using the given SSID ("iot") and password ("jitendra1234"). The ESP8266 keeps checking until it successfully connects to the Wi-Fi network. Once connected, it prints "NodeMCU is Connected!" along with the assigned IP address.

How to Run This Experiment:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the ESP8266 NodeMCU to your computer via USB.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Arduino IDE and select the correct Board (NodeMCU 1.0) and Port.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Replace "iot" and "jitendra1234" with your actual Wi-Fi SSID and Password.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the provided code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud rate) to see the connection status.

Experiment 3: Controlling an LED using ESP8266 Web Server
Components:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
LED (any color)
220Œ© resistor
Wi-Fi Network (SSID & Password)
This experiment demonstrates how to control an LED using a web server hosted on an ESP8266 NodeMCU. The ESP8266 connects to a Wi-Fi network and listens for incoming HTTP requests. When a user accesses http://<ESP_IP>/ledon, the LED turns ON. When accessing http://<ESP_IP>/ledoff, the LED turns OFF.

How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The ESP8266 connects to a Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID ("iot") and password ("jitendra1234").
2Ô∏è‚É£ It starts an HTTP server on port 80.
3Ô∏è‚É£ When a client (web browser) sends a request, the ESP8266 reads it and checks for "/ledon" or "/ledoff".
4Ô∏è‚É£ Based on the request, it turns the LED ON or OFF.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The server continues listening for new requests.

How to Run This Experiment:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the LED to D5 of ESP8266 (with a 220Œ© resistor in series).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the provided code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud rate) and note the ESP8266's IP address.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Open a web browser and enter:

http://<ESP_IP>/ledon ‚Üí LED turns ON
http://<ESP_IP>/ledoff ‚Üí LED turns OFF
5Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the LED behavior.

Experiment 4: Controlling an LED using ESP8266 in Access Point Mode
Components:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
LED (any color)
220Œ© resistor
Wi-Fi-enabled device (Laptop/Mobile)
This experiment demonstrates how to control an LED using a web server hosted on an ESP8266 NodeMCU. Unlike the previous experiment, this ESP8266 creates its own Wi-Fi network (Access Point mode) instead of connecting to an existing Wi-Fi network.

How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The ESP8266 creates a Wi-Fi hotspot (SSID: "NodeMCU", Password: "123456789").
2Ô∏è‚É£ A web server starts on port 80.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Any device can connect to the "NodeMCU" Wi-Fi and send HTTP requests to control the LED.
4Ô∏è‚É£ When a user accesses:

http://192.168.4.1/ledon ‚Üí LED turns ON
http://192.168.4.1/ledoff ‚Üí LED turns OFF
How to Run This Experiment:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the LED to D5 of ESP8266 (with a 220Œ© resistor in series).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the provided code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud rate) and note the ESP8266's Access Point (AP) IP address (Default: 192.168.4.1).
4Ô∏è‚É£ On your mobile/laptop, connect to the "NodeMCU" Wi-Fi using password "123456789".
5Ô∏è‚É£ Open a web browser and enter:

http://192.168.4.1/ledon ‚Üí LED turns ON
http://192.168.4.1/ledoff ‚Üí LED turns OFF
6Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the LED behavior.
